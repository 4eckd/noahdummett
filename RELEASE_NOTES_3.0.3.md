# Release Notes - Version 3.0.3

**Release Date:** January 11, 2025  
**Release Type:** Patch Release (Bug Fix)  
**Previous Version:** 3.0.2

## Overview

Version 3.0.3 is a focused patch release that addresses critical build errors and improves the stability of the documentation system. This release resolves MDX syntax highlighting issues that were causing Next.js build failures and ensures smooth development server operation.

## What's Fixed

### üêõ **MDX Syntax Highlighting Resolution**
- **Problem**: Code blocks in blockchain evidence documentation were using unsupported `ethereum` syntax highlighting
- **Solution**: Updated syntax highlighting from `ethereum` to `solidity` for proper Next.js/MDX compatibility
- **Impact**: Eliminates build compilation errors and ensures proper code block rendering

### üîß **Build System Improvements**
- **Problem**: Next.js build was failing due to unsupported syntax highlighting configuration
- **Solution**: Resolved MDX processing errors and improved build stability
- **Impact**: Enables successful production builds and deployment

### üßπ **Development Server Stability**
- **Problem**: Development server showed warnings about missing build manifest files
- **Solution**: Cleared corrupted `.next` build cache and improved cache management
- **Impact**: Cleaner development experience with fewer warnings

### ‚úÖ **Testing Infrastructure**
- **Problem**: Playwright E2E tests needed verification after build fixes
- **Solution**: Confirmed comprehensive testing suite works correctly with preview deployments
- **Impact**: Maintains high-quality deployment validation

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/content/docs/evidence-analysis/blockchain.mdx` - Updated code block syntax highlighting
- `package.json` - Version bump to 3.0.3
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added release documentation
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency lock file updates

### Code Changes
```diff

- ‚úÖ All pages generate without errors
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation passes
- ‚úÖ Linting passes without issues
- ‚úÖ Static generation works correctly

## Deployment Notes

### For Developers
- This is a patch release with no breaking changes
