# Lighthouse Audit Script Refactoring

## Overview
The Lighthouse audit script has been refactored to remove PWA category support and add robust error handling for missing categories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed PWA Category Support
- **Files Updated:**
  - `scripts/lighthouse-audit.mjs`
  - `scripts/run-lighthouse.mjs`
  
- **Changes:**
  - Removed `pwa: 80` from `AUDIT_CONFIG.thresholds`
  - Removed `'pwa'` from `settings.onlyCategories` arrays
  - Removed PWA score extraction from results processing

### 2. Added Safe Category Score Extraction
- **New Function:** `safeCategoryScore(result, key)`
  - Returns `null` if category or score is missing
  - Returns rounded percentage (0-100) if score exists
  - Handles edge cases like null/undefined values

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Optional Chaining:** Added throughout for all category and audit access
- **Null Checks:** Added validation for missing categories in summary generation
- **Graceful Degradation:** Missing categories now show as "N/A" instead of causing errors

### 4. Updated Performance Thresholds
- **Performance:** ≥ 90 (unchanged)
- **Accessibility:** ≥ 95 (unchanged)
- **Best Practices:** ≥ 90 (unchanged)
- **SEO:** ≥ 95 (unchanged)
- **PWA:** Removed

### 5. Improved Summary Generation
- **Null Category Handling:** Skip null categories in threshold checking
- **N/A Display:** Show "N/A" for missing categories in reports
- **Consistent Formatting:** Maintains table structure even with missing data

### 6. Added Comprehensive Unit Tests
- **Test File:** `__tests__/lighthouse-audit.test.js`
- **Test Coverage:**
  - Valid category score extraction
  - Missing category handling
  - Null/undefined score handling
  - Edge cases (0 scores, missing properties)
  - Real-world Lighthouse result structure

## Test Results
All unit tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 9 tests passing
- ✅ Covers all edge cases
- ✅ Validates null handling
- ✅ Tests real-world scenarios

## Benefits
1. **Robustness:** No more crashes due to missing categories
2. **Maintainability:** Clear error handling patterns
3. **Flexibility:** Easy to add/remove categories in future
4. **Reliability:** Graceful degradation when Lighthouse data is incomplete
5. **Consistency:** Both audit scripts follow same patterns

## Migration Notes
- Existing reports will continue to work
- PWA scores will no longer be collected or displayed
- Any CI/CD pipelines using PWA thresholds should be updated
- Scripts are backward compatible with existing Lighthouse reports

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding more granular error reporting
- Add support for custom category configurations
- Implement retry logic for failed audits
- Add performance trend tracking
